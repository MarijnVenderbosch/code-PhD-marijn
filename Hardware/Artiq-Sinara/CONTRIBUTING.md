## General remarks

* Because multiple people will be working on this project, we want to keep the code as clean and readable as possible. Therefore, you should follow the PEP8 python style: https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/. Most Python IDEs have a module for PEP8 code analysis built in. 
* All code should be sufficiently commented.
