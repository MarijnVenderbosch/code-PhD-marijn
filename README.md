# code-PhD-marijn

Scripts for calculations, plots and data analysis of my PhD research. 
Scripts have been tested in a conda environment with default settins. 

The working directory should be set to the parent folder `code-PhD-marijn` for the imports to work.

`Modules` folder contains functions/classes that are imported in the functional scripts under `plotting_scripts` and `calculation_scripts`.
