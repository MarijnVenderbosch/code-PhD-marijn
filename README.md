# code-PhD-marijn

Scripts for calculations, plots and data analysis of my PhD research. 
Scripts have been tested in a conda environment with default settins. 

The working directory should be set to the parent folder `code-PhD-marijn` for the imports to work.

If a script produces a plot, it will be saved to `output` folder. 
`Modules` folder contains functions/classes that can be shared between scripts.
