# code-PhD-marijn

Scripts for calculations, plots and data analysis of my PhD research. 

For the Python scripts I recommend running the Conda distribution to install packages.
Preferably in a separate environment. 

The working directory should be set to the `code-PhD-marijn` folder for the imports to work.
