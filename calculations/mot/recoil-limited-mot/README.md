# Simulates recoil-limited MOT like Sr red MOT

`pylcp_class.py` contains the parameters of the mot like beam geometry, magnetic field and defines the Hamiltonian.

`plot_sr88mot.py` loads the variables, calculates the result and plots it. 

## Roadmap

-[x] Working example object-oriented (seperate class).
-[ ] Realistic beam geometry.
-[ ] Same quadrople magnetic field as we have in the experiment
-[ ] Play around with detuning.
